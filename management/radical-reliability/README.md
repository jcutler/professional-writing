# Radical Reliability

This directory contains two related essays about practicing leadership in uncertain, high-pressure environments.

They are meant to be read together, but serve different purposes.

## Practicing Radical Reliability as a Leader

This essay describes a **stance**: how to behave reliably inside messy systems shaped by uncertainty, power asymmetry, and incomplete information.

It focuses on:
- legibility over reassurance
- repair over perfection
- dignity over control
- responsibility grounded in reality, not hierarchy

Read this first if you want the conceptual foundation.

## How to Try Radical Reliability Without Getting Fired

This companion piece focuses on **practice**.

It is written for people who:
- do not control the system
- want to act with integrity anyway
- need to be careful about risk, incentives, and power

It covers:
- where to start safely
- concrete, low-risk behaviors
- common failure modes
- how AI changes the risk landscape
- when this approach will not work

Read this if you want to try applying the stance in real organizations without confusing integrity with recklessness.

## A Note on Intent

These essays are not a playbook, a manifesto, or a set of rules.

They describe patterns that tend to reduce harm, increase trust, and make responsibility survivable — especially when systems are under strain.

Use what’s useful.
Ignore what isn’t.
Pay attention to what the system rewards.
